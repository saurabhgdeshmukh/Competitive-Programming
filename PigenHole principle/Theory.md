Pigeonhole Principle Definition:

In Discrete Mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if we must put N + 1 or more pigeons into N Pigeon Holes, then some pigeonholes must contain two or more pigeons.

Example:

If Kn+ 1 (where k is a positive integer) pigeons are distributed among n holes than some hole contains at least k + 1 pigeons.

problem-1

Find the minimum number of students in a class such that three of them are born in the same month?

Solution: Number of month n =12

According to the given condition,

K+1 = 3

K = 2

M = kn +1 = 2*12 + 1 = 25

problem-2
Maria makes a bet with Juan. He must buy her at least one chocolate bar every day for the next 60 days. If, at the end of that time, she cannot point out a span of consecutive days in which the number of chocolate bars he gave her was precisely 19, then she will pay for all of the chocolate bars and give them back to him. If she can find such a span, then she gets to keep the chocolate bars. To limit the size of the bet, they agree in advance that Juan will not buy more than 100

chocolate bars in total.

Is there a way for Juan to win this bet?

Solution

The answer is no. For 1≤i≤60
, let ai represent the number of chocolate bars that Juan has bought for Maria by the end of day i. Then 1≤a1<a2<...<a60≤100. Maria is hoping that for some i<j, she will be able to find that ai+19=aj. We therefore also need to consider the values a1+19<a2+19<...<a60+19. By the bounds on a1 and a60, we have a1+19≥20, and a60+19≤119. Thus, the values a1,...,a60,a1+19,...,a60+19 are 120 numbers all of which lie between 1 and 119

.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these numbers must be equal, but we know that the ai
s are strictly increasing (as are the ai+19s), so there must exist some i<j such that ai+19=aj. Maria must point to the span of days from the start of day i+1 to the end of day j since in this span Juan gave her 19

chocolate bars.

In fact, Juan could not win a bet of this nature that lasted more than 56
days, but proving this requires more detailed analysis specific to the numbers involved, and is not really relevant to this course.
